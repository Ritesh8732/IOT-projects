This project is based on internet of thing(iot) . 
The tempearture sensor is kept in room or in a surrounding where we don't want the temperature to be raised above a certain limit .
In this project I have used wifi module (ESP8266) and temperature sensor . A threshold temperature is set in a program , if the temperature exceeded the threshold .
An alert message is sent on the telegram.
